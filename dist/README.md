# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal website! This is the source code repository for the portfolio site hosted at [http://mhroohi.github.io](http://mhroohi.github.io).

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Hossein
- **Version**: 0.0.0
- **Homepage**: [http://mhroohi.github.io](http://mhroohi.github.io)
- **Private**: This project is private and not publicly available.
- **Type**: Module (ES Module)

## Development

This project uses **Vite** as the build tool. Here's how to get started:

### Install Dependencies
First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Available Scripts

- **dev**: Run the development server with Vite.
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  This starts a local development server and watches for file changes.

- **build**: Build the project for production.
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  This will bundle the app and create a production-ready version in the `build` folder.

- **lint**: Lint the project files using ESLint.
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
  This checks the code for potential issues and unused directives. It ensures code quality and consistency across the project.

- **preview**: Preview the production build locally.
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```
  This runs a local server to preview the app as it would appear in production.

### Deployment

To deploy the project to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

This will automatically push the built files to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository, making the site live on GitHub Pages.
